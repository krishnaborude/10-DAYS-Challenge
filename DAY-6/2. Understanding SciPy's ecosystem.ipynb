    "1. Overview of SciPy and NumPy\n",
    "* NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SciPy: Built on top of NumPy, SciPy extends its capabilities by offering additional functionalities for scientific computing, such as optimization, signal processing, linear algebra, and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relationship Between NumPy and SciPy\n",
    "* Dependency: SciPy depends on NumPy. All SciPy functions internally use NumPy arrays as input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extension: While NumPy provides basic operations (e.g., array creation, element-wise computations, linear algebra), SciPy builds upon these with more advanced tools (e.g., optimization, differential equations, signal processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficiency: Both NumPy and SciPy are written in C and Fortran, ensuring high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key Modules in SciPy’s Ecosystem\n",
    "* SciPy consists of several submodules, each catering to a specific scientific computing need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.linalg → Advanced linear algebra (extends numpy.linalg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.optimize → Optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, least squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.stats → Statistical functions and probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.sparse → Sparse matrix handling and operations\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.fft → Fast Fourier Transform (improves upon numpy.fft)\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.signal → Signal processing (filtering, convolution, Fourier transforms)\n",
    "\n",
    "* scipy.integrate → Numerical integration (ODE solvers, quadrature methods)"
